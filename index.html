    Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering. My
    name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm
    <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old and
    currently living in New York City. I've been working for about three years
    at my first adult job: the law firm Quinn Emanuel where (so far) I work in
    everything from complex commercial litigation, to investigations, to
    criminal defense. I graduated from Yale Law School, which I transferred to
    from Georgetown Law after my 1L year. My undergraduate degree in English,
    Political Science, and Philosophy, with a minor in Public Policy and
    International Affairs, was at Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
    Texas.

    As of fall 2025, I've paid off my student loans. I didn't expect that to
    cause such a change in my life, but it feels like rounding a corner and
    seeing an entirely difference landscape. To suddenly have more than enough
    money, and to realize I can now do whatever I want without having to worry
    about paying debt, has made me realize that there is immense undiscovered
    opportunity for me in the world. I'm enjoying my work at the firm as I get
    cooler and cooler assignments with partners I enjoy working with. I'm also
    feeling less like I absolutely have to follow one set career path or else
    everything will fall apart; instead, I feel like I can just enjoy a bit and
    go where life leads for a while. I don't know what comes next, but I think
    it will be nice. I'm ready for it to be easy.

    const ageSpan = document.getElementById("age");
    const birthday = new Date("July 23, 1997 15:11:00 GMT-500");

    const update = () => {
      let ageInYears = (new Date() - birthday) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365;
      ageSpan.innerText = ageInYears.toFixed(8);
    };

    This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I
    realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who
    wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write an article
    intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't
    sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more
    about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else I think
    about. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please,
    reach out if you have any questions or comments.
