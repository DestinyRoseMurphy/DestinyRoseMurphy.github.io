<h1>About Me and This Page</h1>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TdN8ZTR.jpg" style="width: 170px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;" />

<p>Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering.
My name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old, female, and currently living in Washington, D.C., where I just finished my first year at Georgetown Law (sortaâ€”I did the second half of the school year away from the city, because, ya know, plague). For my undergraduate degree I majored in English, Political Science, and Philosophy, and minored in Public Policy and International Affairs at Southern Methodist University. </p>

<p>This past academic year I really enjoyed Georgetown's Curriculum B program, which combines the traditional first year classes with a philosophical look at the basic biases and underpinnings of the law. For this summer, I'm working (remotely) for Georgetown's Annual Review of Federal Criminal Procedure, as well as for the Council for Court Excellence, a DC non-profit that does criminal justice reform work. I sure do miss the open city and the ability to sit in crowded cafes, but I'm safe and healthy, so it's hard to complain. Here's hoping things get back to normal soon. </p>

<script>
  const ageSpan = document.getElementById("age");
  const birthday = new Date("July 23, 1997 15:11:00 GMT-500");

  const update = () => {
    let ageInYears = (new Date() - birthday) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365;
    ageSpan.innerText = ageInYears.toFixed(8);
  }
  setInterval(update, 100);
</script>

<p>This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write an article intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else I think about. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please, reach out if you have any questions or comments.</p>
