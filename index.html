<h1>About Me and This Page</h1>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4aVImCk.jpg" style="width: 170px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;" />

<p>Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering.
My name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old, female, and currently living in Dallas, Texas while I attend SMU. For my undergraduate degree I'm majoring in English, Political Science, and Philosophy, and minoring in Public Policy and International Affairs. 
Right now I'm finishing up my degree and deciding where I want to go to law school, which is very exciting. I'm also working on expanding my knowledge of code, getting stronger and more flexible with yoga, and doing some creative writing projects as a fun end to my undergraduate experience. </p>

<script>
  const ageSpan = document.getElementById("age");
  const birthday = new Date("July 23, 1997 15:11:00 GMT-500");

  const update = () => {
    let ageInYears = (new Date() - birthday) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365;
    ageSpan.innerText = ageInYears.toFixed(8);
  }
  setInterval(update, 100);
</script>

<p>This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write a little diddy intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else. So, I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please, reach out if you have any questions or comments.</p>
