<h1>About Me and This Page</h1>

<p>Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering.
My name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old, female, and currently living in Washington, D.C., where I attend Georgetown Law. For my undergraduate degree I majored in English, Political Science, and Philosophy, and minored in Public Policy and International Affairs at Southern Methodist University. 
Now that I'm in law school, I'm focusing hard on academics, with the goal of getting through 1L with a 3.85. That means lots of briefing cases, reading legal philosophy, and dissecting statutes, which sounds terrible, but is actually pretty fun. I'm very happy to be completing these courses under Curriculum B at Georgetown, which has a more philosophical bent. </p>

  const ageSpan = document.getElementById("age");
  const birthday = new Date("July 23, 1997 15:11:00 GMT-500");

  const update = () => {
    let ageInYears = (new Date() - birthday) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365;
    ageSpan.innerText = ageInYears.toFixed(8);
  }
  setInterval(update, 100);

<p>This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write an article intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else I think about. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please, reach out if you have any questions or comments.</p>
