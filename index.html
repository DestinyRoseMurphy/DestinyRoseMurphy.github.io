    Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering. My
    name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm
    <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old and
    currently living in New York City. I've been working for about two years at
    my first adult job: the law firm Quinn Emanuel where (so far) I work in
    everything from complex commercial litigation, to investigations, to
    criminal defense. I graduated from Yale Law School, which I transferred to
    from Georgetown Law after my 1L year. My undergraduate degree in English,
    Political Science, and Philosophy, with a minor in Public Policy and
    International Affairs, was at Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
    Texas.

    It's been a long time coming, but life now finally feels like I'm a
    well-established adult. For so long I was heading towards this moment in my
    life where I just /am/ a lawyer, with near-constant striving to get here;
    and now, I'm finally here. Work has settled into a constant thrum, which I
    find largely not very stressful, though certainly tiring enough to hit the
    2100 billable hour minimum that gets me a year-end bonus. I'd like to be
    doing more criminal work and am trying to scrounge that up at my job while I
    focus on exercise, my personal writing, and taking in New York City in my
    free time. Most of my disposable income goes to paying down my massive
    student loans, but I treat myself almost every month to some luxury, like
    fantastic show tickets or a trip to a spa. I look forward to the future a
    lot, too, and dream of a wedding, a move, a family, and a work-life balance
    that has less emphasis on hours spent at the laptop. All in all life is very
    good. The years of work to get here have paid off, and the life I live now
    is comfortable and joyful beyond my childhood's wildest imaginings.

    This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I
    realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who
    wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write an article
    intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't
    sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more
    about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else I think
    about. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please,
    reach out if you have any questions or comments.
