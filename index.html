    Hello world! Hello beyond as well, I suppose. That would be flattering. My
    name is Destiny Rose Murphy. I'm
    <span id="age" style="font-family: monospace">19</span> years old and
    currently living in New Haven, CT, where I'm in the middle of my 3L year at
    Yale Law. This summer I worked for Quinn Emanuel in NYC, which I really
    enjoyed, and this May I completed my 2L (and first) year at Yale Law, though
    with almost entirely remote classes and a city mostly shuttered by the
    pandemic it barely felt like a year at all. I did 1L at Georgetown Law
    (sortaâ€”I did most of the second semester away from the city, because, ya
    know, plague), and for my undergraduate degree I majored in English,
    Political Science, and Philosophy, and minored in Public Policy and
    International Affairs at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

    Last summer was a mix of great and exhausting. I made new friends in New
    York City and found out that I love living there, but I also missed out on working in person, and I didn't get a lot of the traditional firm summer experience. I was hoping that my 3L year would be closer to normal, but with Omnicron kicking around it's looking like things won't be normal at all any time soon, and I'm starting to lose hope for a big Yale Law or New Haven friend group. So, I'm just going to focus on my professional and academic projects, and I'll try to find joy in helping others as best I can through my work as the first co-founder and co-president of Yale's new transfer students organization, and as a co-leader of Yale's graduate student Jewish group. I'm also doing a lot of waiting to hear back on whether I've been accepted to the various academic opportunities I applied to for post-graduation, which is stressful.

    const update = () => {

      ageSpan.innerText = ageInYears.toFixed(8);

    This blog began because I got my tonsils taken out. During recovery I
    realized there wasn't a lot of good advice to be found online for people who
    wanted to recover quickly and strongly. So, I decided to write an article
    intended to help others out. Then, (partially because sometimes when I can't
    sleep I write about things, and partially because I wanted to learn more
    about coding), I decided to expand the blog to everything else I think
    about. I hope you enjoy reading the stuff that I like to write, and, please,
    reach out if you have any questions or comments.
