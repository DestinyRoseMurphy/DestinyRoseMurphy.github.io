This book came highly recommended by several sources, and, having read it, I would wholeheartedly extend that recommendation to any other student on his or her way to law school. McClurg does a great job balancing practical, applicable advice with a dark wit, for an experience that will leave the reader with a great to-do list and without too much anxiety.

I specifically greatly appreciate McClurg's use of student testimony, which kept the book from straying into a lecture-esque format. Instead, most of the book feels like the best student advice, accumulated, and put into pages that can be accessed in times of need. I keep very few books, but I'll definitely be keeping this one on my shelf for the year to come.
