Finally, I've met Falstaff! I've been hearing about this character years, and I'm so happy to have finally blundered into his plays. I know there are other characters in the play, but few of them seem notable; Prince Hal and Falstaff's banter is what I'm here for and everyone else is a hard meh. I'm hoping to make it out to the Utah Shakespeare festival this summer, and if I do I'll get to see this play performed. Fingers and toes are all crossed.
