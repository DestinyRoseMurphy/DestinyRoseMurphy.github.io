I thought [Democracy](http://amzn.to/2zMaRaq) was going to be a critique on America as it existed during the Vietnam War, like [Mailer's book](/details/2017-10-27-The-Armies-of-the-Night-History-as-a-Novel-the-Novel-as-History) was. When Didion introduced herself as narrator and self-critic, I thought I'd run aground of another [Jonah](/details/2017-09-10-Cats-Cradle). Having finished the book, I'm now pretty sure it's a loosely non-chronological Great Gatsby, with Didion a weary, almost hopeless Carraway beginning to end. 

The fact of the matter is this is a romance novel, which struck me as surprising, and which Didion specifically refutes in the middle of the book. It's a romance novel that's almost entirely disguised by Didion's commitment to telling an unromantic story in an unromantic way. It's a romance novel even though it's called Democracy, and even though it's steeped in political controversy. It's an easy read an an interesting organizational and narrative style, and that's about it.
