What can be said? I read this in less than 48 hours, mostly laying on the floor in front of an electronic fireplace, with no desire to do anything else. King is a fantastic storyteller, and this is a fantastically painful story. Not too realistically spooky to make it unreadable, while at the same time being completely realistically spooky.
