Good Omens is a cult classic, which got it on my list initially. It's also by two of the most celebrated storytellers of our age, which bumped it to a high position. And, it just got a TV show on Amazon Prime, which meant I had to read it before I started seeing spoilers everywhere. Hence, reading it in three days right before the start of law school orientation.

All in all, I thought it was adorable. At times, laugh out loud funny and at times deftly philosophical, the book does a great job of balancing religious cynicism with quality storytelling, managing not to wax poetical too often. The cast of characters does occasionally feel a little bit too wide for its own britches, but everything comes together fairly nicely at the end, and the reader is left with the feeling that she has understood all that she was supposed to, though, knowing Gaiman and Pratchett, she is almost certainly wrong.
