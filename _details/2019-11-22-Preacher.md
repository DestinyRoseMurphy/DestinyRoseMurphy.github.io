Preacher has been on my list for a long time because of its canonical status among graphic novels, and I'm sorely disappointed now that I've read the first book. I was expecting something comparable to Watchmen, but Preacher reads like angsty self-insert fan fiction. Our main character is principled in all the wrong ways, the world-building is ramshackle, and our side characters, especially the love interest Tulip, are barely one-dimensional. The plot is thin and interspersed with gratuitous gore and sex, and the writing is clunky and vulgar for the hell of it. Several of the small story arcs seem like what a goth teenager would write in an attempt to capture his view of the world through hormone-tinted glasses. I will not be finishing the series.
