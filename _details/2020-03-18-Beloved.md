I gave up trying to find books on purpose in the SMU library, which always seems to thwart my searches, and instead just wandered the titles on a row until I found something that looked promising. I'd heard of Beloved before so I picked it up, and it turned out to be a fantastic read to help fill up the COVID-19 quarantine. I was very surprised by the content though, since I'd heard of it as a book that was read in school; packed with racial and sexual violence, this is not a book I would recommend to a middle or highschooler. Still, beautifully written and potent, it's a good book for an adult.
