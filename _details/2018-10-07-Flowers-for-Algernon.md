I read all of Flowers for Algernon in a single evening because I could not bear to fall asleep before finishing it. This book is heartbreaking from beginning to end and philosophically interesting throughout. It highlights the importance of memory to intelligence, the contrary natures of intellectual and emotional knowledge, and the horrifying ways that society  treats beings that have been labeled "lesser." I have no criticisms. 

I recommend this book to everyone in academia, especially ethicists and English majors.
