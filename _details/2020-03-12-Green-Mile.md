I went looking for a Neil Gaiman book to read instead of being productive over the spring break of my 1L year, and, because I am very bad at libraries, I stumbled on and settled for this book instead. I had seen the movie some eight or nine years prior, so I remembered most of the plot, but it was nice to read the thing as it was written. King is, as always, a fantastic storyteller. I especially appreciate his works, like this one, that use less horror and more suspense. All in all, a great book to procrastinate on outlining with.
