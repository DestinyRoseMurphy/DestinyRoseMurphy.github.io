I read Bonk as a way to escape from school work, and boy did it work. Roach does an amazing job of merging the academic with the hilarious via her footnote musings and neat, journalistic/narrative style. I was slightly disappointed with my take-away from Bonk (we essentially know very little about sex and how to make it better), but I appreciate that Roach was honest and did not try to force a some sort of hopeful moralism where none exists. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who copulates; it may not give much substantive instruction in the realm of sex ed, but it does speak of sex with a frankness that is in of itself encouraging.
