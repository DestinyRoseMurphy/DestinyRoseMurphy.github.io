A scene from this play was mentioned in my contracts and torts class this semester, so I decided to read the full thing. I'm not sure how to feel about this play. On the one hand, I think the play wants me to sympathize with Willy and his sons, and I just flat don't. The struggling American man, driven insane by the drudgery of capitalism and the loss of his dream to be a land-stealing, misogynist rich asshole doesn't resonate with me. On the other hand, I appreciate that the play does recognize on some level that the plight of Willy and his sons is not universalâ€”Bernard is depicted as successful, in contrast to Willy's sons, apparently because he actually studied. Biff's self-realization at the end of the play that he is "a dime a dozen" seems sincere, and if it is then I appreciate the play's willingness to shine a harsh light on the internally-created inadequacies of the kind of man that the male Loman's represent. However, the sorrowful tone at the end of the play undercuts what I want to be a self-critical theme, leaving me largely unsatisfied. In sum, I'd like to see the play produced on stage to decide whether I like it or not.
