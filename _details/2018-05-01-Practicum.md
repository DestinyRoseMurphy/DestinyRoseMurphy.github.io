During my junior year I had to complete a practicum for my Tower Center minor in Public Policy and International Relations. At the time, I didn't include it here in my list of publications, but in 2024 I realized hey, I'm putting this on my website, it's something I should publicize!

So, below is the link to the website I made. It isn't gorgeuos, but I'm proud of the work I did to make this data public, and the interesting stuff I uncovered about prosecuting patterns in Texas. I hope you enjoy!
