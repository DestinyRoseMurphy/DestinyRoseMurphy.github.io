This play was painfully boring in its entirety. Catherine was sort of a strong character in the beginning, but she faded into subservient nothingness in Act 4. All the men were vaguely ambitious and stupid, and not worth the trouble of telling apart. While I understand that we read this play because it tracks with the political change theme of my Shakespeare course, I do not ever wish to read it again.
