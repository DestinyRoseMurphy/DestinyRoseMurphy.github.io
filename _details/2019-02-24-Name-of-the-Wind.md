The Name of the Wind is perfect for someone who has read Tolkien and thought, "I wish this was just a little less descriptive." Not significantly less descriptive, mind you. Rothfuss spends a great deal of time on setting a literary language, so any readers that need constant action would probably not enjoy this writing. But at least with Rothfuss you will only get a single page's worth of description about a town, instead of Tolkien's average of three pages. 

Overall, I enjoyed reading The Name of the Wind, but I was somewhat disappointed by its lack of ending. This book is the first of what appears to be an unfinished trilogy, and, unfortunately for the reader, this book's final chapter is more of a pause than a stop, keeping you stuck in the rising action of the story. I wouldn't mind that so much if the thing wasn't over 600 pages, but by the time I finished this tome I wanted a resolution, and I got none. So, I would only suggest reading this book if you have time to read all of them, which will require waiting for the third one to come out.
