After the first hundred pages of Kondo's [lightly illustrated sequel](http://amzn.to/2EgTe2e) I realized I was unlikely to find the tidying tips and tricks I had originally picked the book up for. Though the book does contain some organizing specificities (be sure to use the full height of the cabinets under sinks), almost all of the practical advice given within could have easily been extrapolated from the more general instructions found in Kondo's [first book](/details/2017-10-16-The-Life-Changing-Magic-of-Tidying-Up.md). 

Although the book wasn't particularly practically useful, the reading experience was still enjoyable. Kondo's passion for what she does seeps through her pages, pages which are full of interesting windows into Japanese life and culture. The animism that pervades Kondo's tidying philosophy is joined in this novel by classical elements of feng shui, and then explained largely in references to food; never before have I been told my underwear should look like spring rolls when properly stored. I probably won't use most of what's in this book, but if you're looking for a bit more encouragement to start tidying up, this seems like a good place to start.
