It takes me a good while to recover between King's novels and short stories, but so far they have all been worth the terror. The Shining is no different, absolutely worthy of its cultural significance. King's use of flow of consciousness to build his characters is delightful, almost as much as his meticulous imagery. I hope I'll recover quickly from this fright, so that I can have another.
