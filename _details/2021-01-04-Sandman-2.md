The second in the Sandman series, and just as interesting as the first. Death, Desire, and Despair have been introduced (and Destiny and Delirium hinted at), with Desire presenting as an aggressively gender-fluid (and maybe evil-ish?) new sibling. Although I understand why Desire, specifically, would need to exist across the gender spectrum, I think Desire's gender fluidity calls into question why the other Endless seem to have set genders. What about Dream is only masculine, and what about Death and Despair are only feminine? 

Apart from that queer-y, Gilbert is great and The Corinthian is terrifying. That is all.
