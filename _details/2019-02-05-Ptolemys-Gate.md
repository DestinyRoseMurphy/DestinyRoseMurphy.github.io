This final book in the Bartimaeus Trilogy really blew me away. Unlike the other two novels, I had forgotten almost the entirety of the plot of this book, and Stroud had me greatly enjoying the twists and turns along the way. I appreciate the main character's personal growth and sacrifice, as well as the female foil character's role as an important and growing person, not just a love interest. I think this novel perfectly balances adult themes and young adult reading-level, and I would suggest it to any teenager or fantasy-enjoying adult.
