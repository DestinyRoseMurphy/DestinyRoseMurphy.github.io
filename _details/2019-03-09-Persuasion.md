This book was assigned by my Creating Compelling Narrative professor as a supposed example of mastery of the art, but I simply cannot see the attraction. Almost the entirety of the book is written in the style of contemplative narrative summary, making it exceedingly boring to read, since action is almost purposefully stifled throughout. The main character manages to be thoughtful and erudite enough to distinguish herself as unique from the rest of the company, but she remains vain and impractical enough to be just as unlikeable as the rest of them anyways. The plot is see through, the setting is drab, and the supporting characters are often such horrendous caricatures that reading about them is actively displeasing. While I recognize that Jane Austen's work is an important turning point in the history of women's literature, I just can't bring myself to enjoy reading it.
