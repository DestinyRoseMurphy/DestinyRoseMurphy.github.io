During the winter break of my sohpomore year I studied abroad for twelve days in Poland with the SMU Embrey Human Rights department. The purpose of the trip was to study Holocaust affected areas, specifically through the lense of sites of memorials and museums all over Poland. When I returned to the states, the Tower Center asked me to write a short blog post about my experiences.
