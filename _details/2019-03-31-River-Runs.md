Like *Persuasion,* this book was assigned for my Creating Compelling Narrative class. The professor has admitted that she assigned this book as a way to sort of counteract *Persuasion:* a man's story to balance against the woman's. I think both stories are written for a different kind of person than me. This tale seems to be almost entirely made up of contemplative scenes, like *Persuasion* was, with all of the action of the story happening suddenly at the end, delivering an emotional gut punch to the largely unprepared reader. Like *Persuasion, A River Runs Through It* can not boast a great many interesting characters, and indeed paints unlikeable pictures of almost everyone within. I found the near-constant geographical description of Montana boring and difficult to follow, causing me to keep a watchful eye on the numbers at the bottom of the page, willing them to increase faster. If one wants to feel vaguely sad and detached, I think this story would be a fantastic form of catharsis. Otherwise, I would not recommend it to the young reader.
