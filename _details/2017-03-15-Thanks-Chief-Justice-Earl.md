During the spring break of my sophomore year I flew to D.C. with my Supreme Court Seminar class to do research in the library of Congress. My research focused on the leadership abilities of Civil Rights era Chief Justice Earl Warren. I wrote this little blog post for the SMU Adventures page about my experiences in the papers of the Justices.
