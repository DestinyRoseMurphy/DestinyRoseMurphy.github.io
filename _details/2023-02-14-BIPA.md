At Quinn Emanuel, you're required to spend at least 20 hours a year on a "marketing project" in order to get your bonus. My first year, I used that as an opportunity to learn about a new area of law, and to write an article! My article is about the potential expansion of laws like BIPA, which is Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act. Not direclty in my usual wheelhouse, but very neat. Also, QE shared a [post on LinkedIn about it naming me as a partner,](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/destinyrosemurphy_in-case-you-missed-it-check-out-my-quinn-activity-7043627294480846850-EGun?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) which was pretty fun.
