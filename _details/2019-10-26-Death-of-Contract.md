This book was assigned right before our Bargain, Exchange, and Liability midterm, in theory as a discussion of the legal progression from paternalism, to classical legal theory, and then from CLT to more modern legal theory. I don't know that the theory in this book was particularly useful for our class, but it was an interesting example of critical legal theory in practice. It was also an interesting historical look at the truly nonsensical theoretical foundations of CLT. At least, that's what I'm trying to tell myself, but it was also just super boring and I almost regret reading it because it took so long and was so dry.
