It's been a few days since I finished Carver's collection of short stories, and I'm still not sure how I feel about them. I think these stories aim to capture the gut twisting uncertainty and violence that often comes with what we call love. If that is their goal, then I think they are successful. 

The writing style that Carver uses to accomplish this is challenging and interesting. The characters provide the dialogue of course, but they also influence the plot in interesting ways, not quite narrating the story always, but coloring it with their viewpoints. I think I should read this book again later in life, preferably when I have more academic friends to talk to about it.
