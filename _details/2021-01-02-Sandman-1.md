I've been meaning to read this series for a while, but I found it strangely difficult to track down all the books at once, and I didn't want to start and be unable to finish. My dad got me a box set for Christmas in 2020 though, so I'm finally getting to do the whole series. Although the Sandman and his family and rivals are somewhat reminiscent of the old and new gods in American Gods, the book was mostly surprises: I had no idea The Sandman existed within the DC comics world and was very surprised to see John Constantine, the Justice League, and Arkham Asylum pop up. The plot in this book seemed to be mostly self contained, so I'm interested to see how things progress through the next 10 books.
