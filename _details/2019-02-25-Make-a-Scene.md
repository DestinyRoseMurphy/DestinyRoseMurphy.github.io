This book was assigned as the textbook for my Master's level "Creating Compelling Narrative" class, and I have to say it is the best textbook I have had in college so far. The chapters manage to be short and succinct, without sacrificing a playfulness with language that makes them enjoyable to read. Of course, there can be no perfect and all-encompassing set of directions for writing, but this book is an absolutely fantastic place not only to start, but also to return when writer's block strikes. I highly suggest it for other beginning narrative writers.
