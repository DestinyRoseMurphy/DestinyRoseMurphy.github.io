This is the last Letter from the Editor I wrote for Hilltopics. It was distributed to incoming Honors freshman at AARO, so I partially wrote it as advice for them and partially wrote it for myself as an assessment of the progress I've made as a consumer since my own time at AARO. I hope this encourages other people to decide to invest in everything they own; it took me three years of college to figure that out, but maybe it will only take someone else a few minutes of reading my article.
