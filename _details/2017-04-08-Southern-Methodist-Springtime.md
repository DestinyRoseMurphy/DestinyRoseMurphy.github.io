In the spring semester of my sophomore year I took the Honors poetry class Doing Things With Poems, which led to a newfound adoration for poet William Carlos Williams. As such, when the spring article for the SMU Honors magazine *Hilltopics* came around I decided to branch out of my usual satirical voice and try my hand at poetry. The poem's quality is admittedly a tad bit embarrassing, but it was fun to write.
