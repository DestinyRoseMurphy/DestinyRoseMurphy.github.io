This is the first Letter From the Editor that I ever wrote for Hilltopics, which I was Editor-in-Chief of during the Spring semester of my junior year. It took me a long time to write this article because I didn't want to sound uncaring towards those with fears about robotics, but I also didn't want to endorse those fears. I'm extremely happy with the way the article turned out, and with the way the larger issue turned out as well. SMU's Dedman College of Arts and Sciences shared the article on Facebook within the same day it was published, and that was the icing on the cake.
