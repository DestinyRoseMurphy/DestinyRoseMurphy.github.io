This book came highly recommended from one of my law school mentors, and I found it very interesting, but I don't know that I would recommend it to future 1L's. Although it contains a variety of helpful, specific suggestions to improve legal writing, I think those suggestions may be a bit too detail-oriented for those (like myself) that are just now learning to write in the law school style. However, I'll keep this book (hopefully) for future law review articles, where I'm allowed to write in my own personal style a bit more.
