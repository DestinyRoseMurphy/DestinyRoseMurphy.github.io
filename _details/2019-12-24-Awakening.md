I've read The Awakening before and loved it, and found myself wanting to come back to it after a few months of rather unsuccessful dating in DC. Knowing the ending, the beginning felt a little tedious this time, but I was in love with it again as soon as Edna returned to New Orleans. This story still stings, too true.
