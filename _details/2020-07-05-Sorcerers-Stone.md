I haven't read this series since I was a kid reading it as it came out, so with some of my plague-year free time I thought I'd give it a reread. Going through this first book was like remembering my own memories, my brain filling in the dialogue as I read it. My adult brain is, however, much more critical of the story. Dumbledore knew Quirrell was probably Voldemort and definitely trying to get the stone AND kill HP in the meantime and the dude did nothing? At a minimum that's violating some mandatory reporting laws for caregivers, and realistically big D was in aiding and abetting territory with that move with the invisibility cloak. Wizard law is a mess.
