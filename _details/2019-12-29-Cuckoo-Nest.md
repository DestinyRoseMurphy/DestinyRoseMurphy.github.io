I started reading this book because it is a classic, and I like reading classics so I can talk with people about them. I finished reading this book because it is gut wrenchingly bad, and I wanted to make sure I had read every word, so that if someone ever attempts to praise this thing in front of me I will have all the ammunition I need to properly defend Good Taste against such a slight. Jam packed with sexual harassment, racism, and glorification of the good ol independent minded American man, this book reads like a 400 level course on how to be a self-righteous asshole.
