I was sent this book by a financial advisor who I had chatted with about potentially helping me invest for the first time (because my student loans should be paid off soon! I'm going to have a postiive net worth!). During our conversation I expressed some stress about the risk of the markets, and the advisor recommended that I read this book to get a better perspective on making the decision to take risk with a clear mind. 

The book is largely platitudes, with graphics that are mostly unnecessary. I didn't really enjoy it, nor did I feel like it helped me to improve my comfort with risk. The book's thesis is something like: "To invest, decide what life goals you have, learn what money you need to achieve those goals, make an investment plan to make that money, and then stick to your investment plan even when you're stressed." I knew all that already. My discomfort with investing is more granular in nature, along the lines of wondering what kind of split between stocks and bonds I should be targetting given that I want my money to be accessible for potentially near-term costs like a marriage or a house. The generalities in this book provide no insight into how to work through my questions. But, separately, I've been chatting with friends and found some who can help me make my investment profile, so my questions I think are answered. Ah well.
