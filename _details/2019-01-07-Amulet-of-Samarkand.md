This is the first book in The Bartimaeus Trilogy, which I read when I was much younger. I remembered loving the series and wanted to revisit it as an adult, and so far I'm glad I have. The series is obviously written for young adults, but that makes it very easy and fun to read. It's not quite as amazing as I remembered it, but Bartimaeus' footnotes are still funny enough to make me laugh out loud.
