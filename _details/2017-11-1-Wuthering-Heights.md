Wuthering Heights is the only part of my current Romantic Literature class that I have enjoyed so far, and I enjoyed it not for its romanticism, but for its realism. This book shows what (I think) would really happen if people carried on being classical Romantics in real life: they would grow sick and die after a series of passionate and painfully short love affairs.
