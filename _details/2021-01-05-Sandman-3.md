The third book of the series diverts momentarily from the overarching plot and instead presents a few vignettes into past interactions between the dreaming and waking worlds, including the story of an imprisoned Greek muse, Dream's interactions with Shakespeare and Faerie, a tale about the dreams of cats, and a story that has very little to do with Dream and everything to do with Death and an aging superhero. The vignettes were interesting and well written, but I sped through them wanting to get back to following Dream. I write this summary having already read the fourth book though, and references to events in these little tales have already appeared in the greater story, so perhaps I was too hasty in dismissing these tastes of dream country as inconsequential.
