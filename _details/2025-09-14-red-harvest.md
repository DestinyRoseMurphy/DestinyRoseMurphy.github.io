Red Harvest was the third story in a collection of three that I bought last year because I wanted to read The Maltese Falcon. I came to round out the collection this year because I had enjoyed Thin Man so much last year, and I wanted to refresh my palette after the very boring investment book I'd just finished. Red Harvest hooked my attention, but I didn't like it as much as the Maltese Falcon or the Thin Man: this book is less of a whodunnit and more of a mob story, bursting with many many more than one murder, but none of the murders are really a mystery for long. The writing is crisp and enjoyable in of itself, and a few lines really struck me as simply wonderful, but the subject-matter largely turned me off throughout. I would likely not recommend.
