This is the first event write up I have done for the Tower Center since leaving my job there, and I was largely unsatisfied with the process. Since I am no longer being paid by the Center I felt less required to make my summary complete and neutral, which was not particularly well received. 

The link to the form of my article that was published is below. Similar to my Gente-Fication article, the published version below is quite different from my original writing, but comparing these two write ups is less interesting than the Gente-Fication ones I think, so I have not linked to the original write up below.
