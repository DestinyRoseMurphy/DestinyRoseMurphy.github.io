summary: "I want to see all of Shakespeare's plays, and it's getting difficult to remember which ones I have ticked off, so here they are!"

I love Shakespeare. I read almost all the histories in college and fell in love, and now that I'm an adult with cash and access to good theater I see as much Shakespeare on stage as I can. I dream of seeing every show Shakespeare wrote, including the bad ones, and I have now seen enough of them that I'm struggling to keep track! This post is a tracker for what shows I have seen, when, and where, so that I can know what to look for. Also, so that I can look back fondly on the good shows I have seen, and remember the shows that I hated so that I can see better productions of those.
