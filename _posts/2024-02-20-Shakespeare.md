I love Shakespeare. I read almost all the histories in college and fell in love, and now that I'm an adult with cash and access to good theater I see as much Shakespeare on stage as I can. I dream of seeing every show Shakespeare wrote, including the bad ones, and I have now seen enough of them that I'm struggling to keep track! This post is a tracker for what shows I have seen, when, and where, so that I can know what to look for. Also, so that I can look back fondly on the good shows I have seen, and remember the shows that I hated so that I can see better productions of those.

  				<li>July 15, 2022 - NYC Shakespeare in the Park (a cool reversal of expectations about disability, but the lambast by Richard's mother was done in ASL without an interpreter, and I think it really took away from what the production was trying to accomplish)</li>

<p style="padding-top: 1cm;">Honorable Mentions (Shakespeare-Adjacent): All the Devils Are Here (overview of Shakespearean villains; delightful), The Book of Will (not memorable), Sleep No More (sort of Macbeth but barely; cool spectacle), Drunk Shakespeare (a version that did not adhere to the text, but was nevertheless a fun telling of Macbeth), The Tempest (interpretive dance version; terrible).</p>
