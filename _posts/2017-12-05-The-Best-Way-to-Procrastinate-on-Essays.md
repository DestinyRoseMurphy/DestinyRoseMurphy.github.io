summary:    "I had 50 pages of essay to write in the finals season of my junior fall semester, so instead of doing that I procrastinated by counting how many pages of essay I've written in college, and then learned to code that information into cool graphs."

UPDATE THE DATE AT THE TOP OF THIS FILE, AND IN THE FILE NAME

I didn't have a good definition for essay, so there's some weird things included in here, but these are all essentially writing-based assignments. 

Page numbers are in double spaced pages. Titles are the class, the piece of literature or idea it was written about, and then my original essay title if applicable. Dates are due dates, or if I didn't have that, the date the file was created.

A huge amount of information is missing here, from in class essays that I didn't save copies of to hand written case briefs. The classes I took that I did not have any saved writing assignments for are listed at the bottom of each semester.
