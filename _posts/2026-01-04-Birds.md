title: "Big Bird Year"
date: 2026-1-4
summary: "Turns out birding is really fun and maybe everyone should do it."
---

Every year I make goals at the top of the year and they're all boring: I tell myself all the ways I need to eat right; the exercise I need to do; the amount and kinds of work I want to book; the money I want to save. This year my biggest goal was to pay off my student loans, which in practice means my goal was to just _not_ spend most of every paycheck. (I did it, by the way; I paid those suckers off so hard.) This January, facing down a page of exceedingly tiring and responsible goals, I decided "I need a fun one." I polled some friends for joyous and easy goal ideas and a surprising number of people recommended birding. Thus, with no camera, no binoculars, and no experience, I set myself a goal to spot 50 bird species over the course of the year. I ended up seeing and photography 155.

It turns out birding is SO FUN. It's a great way to explore a new place. It's a lovely start to a morning that sets the tone for a bright and sparkling day. It's essentially free (now that I own a camera), and it's surprisingly social. I'm now convinced that everyone should do it. Since this is the year where I got all the low-hanging-fruit birds for the first time, this may be the bird-iest year I ever have (or at least the bird-iest year I have until I take some vacations to jungles). To celebrate, below is a little journal of my Big Bird Year. May it be the beginning of a lifetime of the same.

<h2>January</h2>

A strong start to the year! I wanted my first bird to be a pigeon and that's what I got, plus some other accidental spots early in the month (house sparrow, cardinal). Later in the month I took myself on a walk through central park to find ducks, and ducks I certainly did find. It was cold, but January really surprised me with how easy it was to find new birds. The pictures for this month (and the next few months) are largely actually from later outings, after I had gotten a nice camera.

<h2>February</h2>

February was a busy month with surprise travel to Nebraska to attend my partner's father's funeral. There was not much moving in the trees in Nebraska, but I saw a few new birds while we were there, including wild turkeys as they crossed the road (which I required us to stop the car for me to capture awful photos of with only my phone).

<h2>March</h2>

My partner found a famous birding tour leader in central park for me this month so I got quite a few new birds and I got to learn from other birders for the first time. I learned that I really liked birding with a knowledgeable group, because being able to ask identification questions to old-ladies-who-have-memorized-all-birds is great fun. Also, I got my first relatively rare bird, the American Woodcock, thanks to a friend from work. It was fun to see something that felt almost like a secret!

<h2>April</h2>

This was the month that really got me hooked. I had a work trip to Hilton Head get cancelled after I had already arrived in town, and finding myself with no deposition to take I stumbled upon (literally accidentally ran into) a birding tour, and then found my way to a second tour that took me to wading-bird nesting season. It was incredible. I realized I was loving this birding stuff, and wanted my own camera to get more zoom and thus clearer pictures.

<h2>May</h2>

I returned to Birding Bob's tour again this month but had a bit less fun, as there were fewer birds out and the group was less lively.

<h2>June</h2>

A trip to DC to bird with friends and try out my brand new camera was an absolutely blast, and then in England I got to experience birding truly alone in a completely unknown area for the first time and I loved it. Wandering the Hampstead Heath outside of London and listening to all new bird calls in the morning air was beautiful.

<h2>July</h2>

July gave me the end of my trip to England, as well as a very low-bird trip to Greece. The only reason I got a new bird on Chios was because we camped out across from a nest for an hour, and the only reason we did that is because we completely accidentally chose a table at a beachside taverna that had a nest built into the corner of it.

<h2>August</h2>

A trip upstate for a cabin weekend for my partner's birthday got me a few new birds and a walk through a meadow at sunrise so stunningly serene that I lost my breath. I cannot overstate the impact this meadow had on me.

<h2>September</h2>

For Labor Day weekend I went to Chicago with my dad to get two new baseball stadiums, and I took him out birding while we were there. Then, back home later in the month I got to do some fall migration birding with friends MUCH more experienced than myself, and it was so fun to see all the passing-through warblers, plus get perhaps my first truly good pictures with my new camera: the hummingbirds.

<h2>October</h2>

For e-bird's fall Big Day I went out to the very tip of Long Island looking for shorebirds. We didn't see a ton, but the black-bellied plovers we did get were uncommon, so that felt pretty cool. I did some more fall-migration birding with a Prospect Park group later in the month and got a good number of birds but didn't love the leader's energy (he did not feel very approachable, seemed to reject photo-identification, and used scientific taxonomy instead of common terms, which was difficult to follow).

<h2>November</h2>

Rounding out the end of the year as it started, I went out with friends looking for ducks at the onset of winter and indeed found some new ones. My Thanksgiving trip home to Texas also landed me a couple new names, though it was unseasonably cold there so I did not get a ton.

<h2>December</h2>

What a finish. 30 new birds in a single week. Hawaii was overwhelming with new things to see, and it has made me really consider if I should plan a true birding trip in the future, because man it was so fun. This trip also really drove home for me how much birding has made me more confident and courageous as a person: on Christmas I drove over an hour before sunset in a rental car to a trail in the middle of nowhere, which I hiked alone to look for endemic birds. And it was worth it. It wasn't just worth it, it was exhilarating (that's where I saw the akiapolaau, which there are fewer than 1,800 of in the wild!) At the beginning of the year I don't think I ever would have gone out on such a limb, but I love that I did, and I can't wait to do so more.
