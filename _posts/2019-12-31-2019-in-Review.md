<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b> 
* Classes I enjoyed were the biggest positive this year, both in my last semester of undergrad and my first semester of law school. More evidence I should become an academic?
* Got really into decorating and interior design this year, now that I have my own space. Would be good to continue that in the future. 
* Shows stayed some of my most frequent positives this year, but I saw a lot fewer movies during this first semester at Georgetown. Need to get a movie-crew together, or remember to go alone to see movies when they come out.

<b>Negatives:</b>
* Relationship stress was the biggest negative this year. Not really sure how to avoid that, other than not getting another abusive parent or dying long term relationship? 
* Poorly planned trips were another negative this year, though I think that was largely related to relationship stuff. However, confirming details with whomever is planning for the day may be worth adding to a checklist
