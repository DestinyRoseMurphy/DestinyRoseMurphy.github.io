title: "100 Goals"

summary: "Why have one New Year's Resolution, when you can have 100?"
---

A good friend of mine told me about this exercise while he was doing it, having been prompted by a time tracking book. I've never been one for New Year's Resolutions, but I do like using the turning of the year to think on ways to improve, so I thought this would be a nifty way to get at it. Below are (at least) 100 goals, from tiny, to huge, some accomplished, some unaccomplished, and some undoubtedly never to be accomplished. In the new year, and the new decade, I'll hopefully knock some off the list!
