summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't spark joy in my life. In doing so, I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why."

Below is a complete list of everything I own, as of October 19th, 2017. This is the first iteration of this post, which I'll be updating regularly. The original inspiration for this was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up,* which I reviewed here. Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't "spark joy" in your life should be gotten rid of.
All of these items survived my purging - below I detail why. If you like something and it's underlined, click on it! You'll be sent to Amazon and you can get it for yourself!

## Everyday Carry - My Backpack

* My stepmother's Navy-issue backpack - When my step-mom, who was an equipment operator chief in the Navy reserves, retired from the service she got rid of all her military-issue supplies, and she gave me the option to take anything I wanted. My entire life I had gotten a new backpack for each school year because I destroyed each pack throughout the course of each year. I took her backpack on a whim, thinking it might stand up a little longer to my textbooks. That was in 2014, and it's still holding strong today.

#### In That Backpack

* American Airlines blanket - I don't create a lot of body heat, and I spend most of my days in frigidly air-conditioned buildings, so I carry one of those free American Airlines blankets with me for emergencies. I probably use it once a week. I haven't found any blanket as perfectly small, warm, easily folded. 
* Collapsible black travel umbrella - Purchased in a little shop in England when I found myself caught in the rain, this umbrella is perfect for emergencies. 
* Plastic Bag of drugs, band-aids, & feminine products - Useful for emergencies as well, especially for helping others. 
* 8GB 12 Inch MacBook and charger - Owned by a friend of mine who let me borrow it when my laptop crashed during finals.
* BlueSky Weekly/Monthly July-June Agenda - I bought this agenda my freshman year and found it to be so perfect that I have bought an identical version every year since. It couldn't be better. 
* Decomposition Books - A stylish and environmentally friendly option for school notes. A little more expensive than a plan composition book, but worth it. 
* Allies bag tag - Awarded to me after my completion of Allies training to denote my official Allie status. 

## My Purse

* Black Dooney & Burke purse - A gift old enough that I don't remember when I got it, but quality purses hold up to a lot of use, and this shoulder purse is big and professional enough for everything I need, while still remaining casual and carry-able.

#### In That Purse

* Grey Giorgio Armani glasses - I need them to see, and I look objectively better with them on.
* iPhone 6 - Several versions old now, but still working fine (if a little slowly).
* Pink and white OtterBox wallet phone case - Keeps my phone from cracking even though I drop it nearly every day, and holds my drivers license, Chase debit, and Discover credit card. It's discoloring now with use, but has never broken. Discover's Cashback function helps me to get little rebates as I improve my credit with little food purchases. 
* Neiman Marcus yellow card/coin purse - Another years old gift that has never lost its usefulness. Holds my health insurance card, cash and coins, and whatever gift or rewards cards needed on a particular day.
* Ford Escape car key - Loose in my purse. Should probably not be.
* Tiny carabiner - Only a couple inches in length, but it holds my house and work keys, and my school ID.
* Monogrammed business card holder - Given to me as a going away gift by my first internship, this holds my student business cards. 
* Anita NARS lipstick - The perfect professional shade, with a magnetic case that doesn't come open in your purse
* Vera Bradley On a Roll pencil bag - Nomadic floral patterned. Holds various pencils, pens, erasers, highlighters, and Sharpies that rotate as I find and lose them.
* Precise V5 RT Pilot Pen - The smoothest, most penetrating ink pen I've found. This one lives outside of my pencil bag so that I still have a pen even when I take my pencil bag out for non-school functions.
* urBeats by Dre headphones - A gift that functions and has a nifty tiny bag for carrying. 
* eos lip balm - These spherical lip balms are incredibly difficult to lose, making them invaluable. I'm currently on the purple striped one, and I have been for months.
* Fingernail clippers - The cheapest and smallest I could find
* Tampax tampons - I'm currently experimenting with using a diva cup, but these are good for emergencies and for helping out friends in need. 
* Benadryl - Because I'm allergic to some orange dyes and so need to carry antihistamines with me everywhere. 
* Minastrin daily birth control
* Albuterol sulfate inhaler - Because sometimes my meat suit betrays me and forgets how to breathe.
