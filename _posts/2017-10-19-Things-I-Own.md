summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's *The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up* I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't spark joy in my life. In doing so, I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why."

Below is a complete list of everything I own, as of October 19th, 2017. This is the first iteration of this post, which I'll be updating regularly as I move throughout life. The original inspiration for this post was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up,* which I reviewed here. Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't spark joy in your life should be gotten rid of, and anything that does spark joy should be given a purposeful place in your space (home, office, etc.) to live. So, below is a list of everything that I own that I would defend my ownership of if someone tried to take it from me. This is everything that survived the purge, and why. If you like something and it's underlined, click on it! You'll be sent to Amazon and you can get it for yourself!

## Everyday Carry


* My stepmother's Navy-issue backpack - When my step-mom, who was an equipment operator chief in the Navy reserves, retired from the service she got rid of all her military-issue supplies, and she gave me the option to take anything I wanted. My entire life I had gotten a new backpack for each school year because I destroyed each pack throughout the course of each year. I took her backpack on a whim, thinking it might stand up a little longer to my textbooks. That was in 2014, and it's still holding strong today.

### In That Backpack

* American Airlines blanket - I don't create a lot of body heat, and I spend most of my days in frigidly air-conditioned buildings, so I carry one of those free American Airlines blankets with me for emergencies. I probably use it once a week. I haven't found any blanket as perfectly small, warm, easily folded. 
* Collapsible black travel umbrella - Purchased in a little shop in England when I found myself caught in the rain, this umbrella is perfect for emergencies. 
* Plastic Bag of drugs, band-aids, & feminine products - Useful for emergencies as well, especially for helping others. 
* 8GB 12 Inch MacBook and charger - Owned by a friend of mine who let me borrow it when my laptop crashed during finals.
* BlueSky Weekly/Monthly July-June Agenda - I bought this agenda my freshman year and found it to be so perfect that I have bought an identical version every year since. It couldn't be better. 
* Decomposition Books - A stylish and environmentally friendly option for school notes. A little more expensive than a plan composition book, but worth it. 
* Allies bag tag - Awarded to me after my completion of Allies training to denote my official Allie status.

* Black Dooney & Burke purse - A gift old enough that I don't remember when I got it, but quality purses hold up to a lot of use, and this shoulder purse is big and professional enough for everything I need, while still remaining casual and carry-able.

### In That Purse
