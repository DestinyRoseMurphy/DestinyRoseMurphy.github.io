summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's *The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up* I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't "spark joy" in my life. In doing so, I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why.

Below is a complete list of everything I own, as of October 19th, 2017. This is the first iteration of this post, which I'll be updating regularly as I move throughout life. The original inspiration for this post was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up,* which I reviewed here. Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't spark joy in your life should be gotten rid of, and anything that does spark joy should be given a purposeful place in your space (home, office, etc.) to live. So, below is a list of everything that I own that I would defend my ownership of if someone tried to take it from me. This is everything that survived the purge, and why.
