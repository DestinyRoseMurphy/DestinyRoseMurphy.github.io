<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b> 
* Time with friends and time with pets was best this. Sitting alone in a room for extended periods of time? Not great. I'm hoping to get a cat in 2021, and intending to make a concerted effort to get more social engagement to capitalize on these things.
* Video games were also a big positive this year, and one I feel like I've neglected the past year at least. I should stay on the lookout for new games I like!
* Improving the space around me like by gardening and decorating brought me a lot of joy. I've been saying for at least a year now that I want to take a course in interior decoratingâ€”I should really get to that.
* Having a bright living thing to be near me, like flowers or a tiny pumpkin, has a surprisingly big impact on my mood. I need to find a flowers place here in New Haven maybe, or just keep growing new plant friends.

<b>Negatives:</b>
* Obviously being sexually assaulted by your best friend and then experiencing an international pandemic in which an incredibly important nail-biter election happens isn't great, but I also don't think it was avoidable in any way. Positive coping mechanisms are the best way to deal with these big bads I think, which really just means doing more of what's above.
