I spent my 2017 summer romping around the English countryside and beyond. From this page you can see all of my adventures, and, if you're lazy, you can read the shorter version.

#TL;DR

July 1st - Getting to England is a long and arduous process, but then I am there, and it is wonderful. I see the Oxford Garden, almost cry from the beauty of the place, and then fall asleep very early, exhausted from jetlag.

July 2nd - I explore the city of Oxford a bit on my own and with the help of a guide, take in the local cuisine, and am formally welcomed to the college with convocation.

July 3rd - I have my first day of classes, manage to miss one of them, and meet up with my friend Christian to explore Oxford just a bit more.
