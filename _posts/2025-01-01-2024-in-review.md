<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b>

- A lot of my specific happy moments this year are just hangouts with friends, whether they be birthday parties or just a double date or having someone over to chat. Making time to really get to connect with individuals in my growing friend group is great.
- I got to see so many great shows this year and they were all worth the money. Definitely want to see many more of those!

<b>Negatives:</b>

- I hit my insurance deductible for the first time ever this year because I got sick much more than normal. None of that illness was really preventable, but it was very uncomfortable and stressful. 
- Job searching while working this year was simply too much, and I really burnt out on it in July. I think my definition of what I want to do for work is changing, but I just feel a lot of uncertainty around that so it is hard to make goals that can provide the right direction. 
- Starting in late October I had some relationship stress that took up a lot of my spoons. Going into the new year I'm hopeful some counseling will help.
