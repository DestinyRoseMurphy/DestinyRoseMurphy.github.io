title: "100 Goals Take Two"
date: 2022-05-27
summary: "An update to my 100 goals!"
---

About three years ago I performed this goals-setting activity in the place of New Years Resolution's, and then I pretty promptly forgot about it. Late last year an interviewer stumbled across my list, and he brought it up in my interview by pointing out that I was interviewing for a position I'd identified that I wanted years previously. His mentioning of my post got me thinking about how these goals really still represent a lot of things I want to do, but they could use an update. So, to celebrate graduating law school (a very old goal) and converting to Judaism (a relatively new goal) I decided to update my list! Below are my goals as I view them as a brand new lawyer and Jew.

This list is different from my original one in a few important ways: First, I no longer count "Checked Off" goals in my list of 100. I did that initially because identifying 100 goals felt impossible. Now—three years outside of the abusive relationship with my biological mother, and immensely more confident in and happy with who I am as a person—100 goals is something I know I can aspire to without needing to count things I've already done. Second, I've created a space for continuous goals that are not intended to be checked off at any point. Finally, I now have a section of goals that I removed from my previous list (also not counted in the 100). I think these goals are important to keep visible, both because some of them represent things I used to want that I no longer want, and because some of them are things I failed to achieve during the time period I could have achieved them. Thus, they all represent areas of growth and learning in my life that I have no intention of forgetting.
