Goals of this Post
	This post is intended to help others who are considering, or are currently in the midst of, a tonsillectomy. I was about a month away from being 20 when I had mine, and was generally healthy with a history of chronic strep throat. At the time of my surgery I was getting strep about four times a year, most likely thanks to the community bathrooms in my dorm. Take that into consideration when comparing your experiences to mine, since age and health are both a factor in recovery. I hope you find something to help you!
My Experience
	The surgery itself was easy-peasy. It took maybe twenty-five minutes tops, and the most painful thing was getting the IV in. After the surgery, I felt great because of the anesthesia still pulsing through my veins. I walked to the car confidently. Then we got home. Then I took my first dose of pain meds: liquid hydrocodone. Then things got worse. I vomited, twice. The anesthesia was starting to wear off, and my whole body was feeling wrong because of it: blurred eyesight, heavy limbs, and of course, nausea. Throat pain wasn’t especially bad because of the cocktail of narcotics in me, but I generally felt awful. That’s essentially how the first several days went for me. 
	I was constantly stoned. Some people love the drug I was on; they do it for fun. For me, it was not fun. Narcotics make me itchy, everywhere, as if my skin is crawling. From what I understand this is because opiods release histamines, which can cause allergic-style reactions.  
Tl;dr “My Experience”
How to Recover Faster and Healthier
	Putt Stuff in Your Butt
	Remember Pain is Temporary
	Just Frickin’ Eat
	Be Wary of Drug Side Effects
	Pull a Bill Whithers (Lean on Your Friends)
In Conclusion
	Surgery is easy, but recovery is hard, especially if you aren’t willing to put yourself through pain to avoid pain.
