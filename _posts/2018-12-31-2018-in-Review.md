summary:    "A quick review of all the highs and lows of 2018."
---
I stole the idea for this from <a href="https://christian.gen.co/2017-review">Christian Genco (who stole it from Tim Ferriss)</a> as a way to summarize the past year and plan improvements for the upcoming year. The general idea is you go through your calendar and record the things that made you happy and the things that made you sad each month. That way, you can try to get more of the happy's and less of the sad's next year. Below is my 2018 year in review, with the especially impactful items bolded, and a summary at the bottom.

<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b> 
* Travel is the big winner this year. Seeing, eating, and doing new things in new places is the way to go.
* Good shows are consistently good! Spend the money on plays, comedy, and movies, and you won't be disappointed. 
* Spend more time outside. Patios, walks through gardens, and biking consistently make you feel good (and keep you healthy).
* Good food, whether its eating out or cooking in, makes you really happy. Keep learning new recipes and trying new restaurants!
* Get more massages. They're expensive, but they're great and they keep your back from hurting. 

<b>Negatives:</b>
* Poorly planned travel can really ruin a day.  Remember to spend the extra money for a nice place to stay, or a flight instead of a drive.
* You're grumpy when you're cold and wet. I need to invest in some warmer and more waterproof gear ASAP. 
* Being rushed and feeling under-prepared for important things creates a lot of stress. Next year, early research is the way to go for big decisions.
* Make sure to take breaks for yourself during stressful times. Over-scheduling makes you stressed, especially when. it's over-scheduling with other people.
