<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b>

- This was a huge year for vacations. Japan! Hawaii! Baseball weekend and ren fest weekends! Vacations are pretty great. I'd definitely like to plan another nice two week one, maybe 2025. 
- Being in love is pretty great. Moving in with the person you love is pretty great. A lot of love this year. 

<b>Negatives:</b>

- Honestly not a lot of negatives this year. A bit of various interpersonal stress, a bit of the normal stress of traveling. But I'm really not sure on lesson's learned from negatives this year--kind of just feels like this stuff went well. 
- Work was a bit stressful a couple times this year, though I think I handled it pretty well. Definitely want to keep an eye on work stress though and make sure it doesn't become the norm. 
- I'm starting to feel the money stress associated with having big student debt, for sure. I'd like to get that worked down ASAP, and I've got a plan for how to do it next year.
