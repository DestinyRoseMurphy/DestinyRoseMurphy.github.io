<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b>

- Getting to cultivate plants indoors this year REALLY gave me a lot of joy. I think prioritizing having a space with sunshine, and plants in that space, will bring me a lot of joy in the future.
- As with last year, interacting with animals continued to be some of the highlights of the year. I REALLY want to try to get a cat next year.
- This year I got to have more time with friends (because less pandemic) and friend time consistently made my Positives list. Unlike relationship time, it's less likely to be associated with stress. In 2022, I'm going to focus on purposefully scheduling friend time.

<b>Negatives:</b>

- My most consistent stress this year came from various romantic relationship troubles, which is difficult to "fix" because a lot of my big positives of the year came from romantic relationship things too. I'm pretty sure that's just the paradox of being vulnerable and known with people, but I'll try to keep my eye out next year to make sure I'm not staying in situations that aren't great.
