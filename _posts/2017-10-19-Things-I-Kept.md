summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't spark joy in my life. That meant I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why."

The original inspiration for this was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,* which [I really enjoyed.](/details/2017-10-16-The-Life-Changing-Magic-of-Tidying-Up) Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't "spark joy" in your life should be gotten rid of. So, I purged, and everything I kept (and why I have it) is listed below. If you like something and it's underlined, click on it! You'll be sent to its online listing so you can buy it and try it out for yourself.

I began this list January 11th, 2018. It's the first iteration of this post, which I'll (try to) update annually. The most recent update was on: January 4th, 2021. You'll notice an obscene amount of detail here; that's purposeful. By admitting to every item in my home I have to be willing to defend every item, or to accept that it's indefensible. If you have suggestions please give them! I keep notes on what I think I to put more thought into in my "What I Need to Improve" section, and would love to put your notes there as well.

## <a name="Improve"></a> What I Need to Improve

* I haven't put a whole lot of thought or research into what goes in and around my body during bathroom time. Seeing as things like soap, toothpaste, and deodorant touch sensitive parts of me every day, I should probably do some research.
* Specifically within the bathroom I should cement my knowledge of hair and makeup products. These things can affect my confidence a lot during the day, and I'm currently blundering through them. 
* Should upgrade from plastic to glass for kitchen items like Tupperware and pitchers. 
* Does the kind of soap I use for things like dishes and laundry matter? I feel like it might but don't know, so that needs researching. 
* I've got way too many things in my desk. Really need to cull that down. 

## <a name="Everyday"></a> <a name="Backpack"></a> Everyday Carry - My Backpack

* My stepmother's Navy-issue backpack - When my stepmom, who was an equipment operator chief in the Navy reserves, retired she got rid of all her military-issue supplies, and she gave me the option to take anything I wanted. My entire life I had gotten a new backpack at the beginning of each school year, torn it to pieces via the weight and stress of my schoolwork, and repeated the process. I took her backpack on a whim, thinking it might stand up a little longer to my textbooks. That was in 2014, and it's still holding strong today.

#### In That Backpack

* American Airlines blanket - I don't create a lot of body heat, and I spend most of my days in frigidly air-conditioned buildings, so I often carry one of those free American Airlines blankets with me for emergencies. I probably use it once a week. I haven't found any blanket as perfectly small, warm, easily folded. 
* Collapsible green travel umbrella - Purchased in a little shop in DC when I found myself caught in the rain, this umbrella is perfect for emergencies. 
* Plastic Bag of drugs, band-aids, backup birth control, & feminine products - Also useful for emergencies, especially for helping others. 
* Allies bag tag - Awarded to me after my completion of [LGBT Allies](https://www.hrc.org/blog/how-to-be-an-lgbt-ally) training at SMU. 
* Restore Your Vote Button, Philosophy Owl Patch - For decoration


## <a name="Purse"></a> My Purse

* Leather Fossil Cross Body purse - A gift from my dad that combines fashion and function. Quality purses hold up to a lot of use, and this cross body is perfectly sized and professional enough for business carry, while still remaining casual enough that I can be comfortable using it everywhere - even biking in it. 

#### In That Purse

* Grey Giorgio Armani glasses - I need them to see, and I look objectively better with them on.
* Pink Oliver Peoples sunglasses w/case - Expensive as all get out, but I feel confident in them
* Teal Glasses Cleaning Cloth - It's a color I like, it works like a charm
* iPhone XS - Another gift from my dad and stepmom. I love the huge screen.
* Otterbox blue and pink phone case - A good combination of sturdy and fashionable.
* RE yellow card/coin purse - Replaced my old coinpurse with this one for more capacity. Holds my health insurance card, cash and coins, and whatever gift or rewards cards needed on a particular day. Also brings me joy, because it's yellow.
* Tiny carabiner - Only a couple inches in length, but it holds my house keys.
* [Precise V5 RT Pilot Pen](http://amzn.to/2zpqogK) - The smoothest ink pen I've found. Good enough that I'd re-buy it if I lost it, unlike every other pen I own.
* [Symphonized Wood Headphones](https://amzn.to/2J02Nor) - Aesthetically pleasing and they function and fit my ears. They come with a little shirt clip that really helps to keep at least one ear from slipping out while I exercise. 
* [Audio-Technica ATH-SR30BTGY Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MPLDK8X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Headphone to phone adapter - Because Apple sucks for removing the headphone jack 
* Headphone/Charger Splitter - For train and plane rides when charging and listening to music at the same time becomes necessary
* Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm
* Blisovi daily birth control 
* A tampon, some Benadryl, and a tiny nail clipper - For emergencies
* Albuterol sulfate inhaler - Because sometimes my meat suit betrays me and forgets how to breathe.

## <a name="Kitchen"></a> Kitchen
I got my first kitchen all to myself in the fall semester of 2017, and I've been trying to figure out how to cook ever since. On the hardware side I try to follow Saint Alton's advice and [stay away from "Unitaskers,"](https://lifehacker.com/watch-alton-brown-demonstrate-why-unitaskers-have-no-1749470145) and I have so many opinions about what foods we put in our bodies that [I wrote a Tedx Talk about food and used it to talk to kids about drugs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7jgNi4Ew8)

#### <a name="Food"></a> Food
I don't have a natural talent for cooking, nor do I particularly enjoy it day to day, but nutrition and health are important to me, so I try to be conscious of what I eat. Below are some of my most common dietary choices, all of which I'm trying to improve.
	
* Grass-fed whole milk - I drink more than is socially acceptable
* Pasture-raised eggs - Used most in burritos and occasionally in mixed bowls and pancakes, I buy expensive eggs because I think they're better for the planet and [better for me](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/renewable-agriculture-and-food-systems/article/vitamins-a-e-and-fatty-acid-composition-of-the-eggs-of-caged-hens-and-pastured-hens/552BA04E5A9E3CD7E49E405B339ECA32)
* Bacon - This almost certainly isn't good for me, but it's a relatively harmless vice to be put in burritos and mixed bowls
* Mexican cheese blend - Also for burritos
* Burrito tortillas 
* Banza protein pasta - Because pasta is easy to batch and tasty, but contains too many simple carbohydrates to be eaten daily
* Whole Foods pesto - For the pasta
* Chunked pancetta - Usually from my local Italian market, for the pasta
* Cherry tomatoes - A new addition to be blistered and added to the pasta, and occasionally to burritos 
* Olive oil - For pasta, but also just for general cooking
* Kodiak Cakes protein pancake mix - I batch small pancakes and freeze them for quick breakfasts or between-class snacks
* Frozen cauliflower - Boiled and hidden in the above-mentioned pancakes, for nutrition
* Sweet potatoes - Generally cubed and frozen, I use these for a base in bowls 
* Avocado oil - Has the [highest smoke point](https://chosenfoods.com/blogs/central/top-4-reasons-why-you-need-to-be-cooking-with-avocado-oil) of common cooking oils, and so is probably the best to cook with
* Avocado oil mayonnaise - Usually in bowls with the sweet potatoes, so tasty
* Fire roasted frozen corn - Used for sweet potato bowls
* Rice - Sometimes I just need carbs 
* Frozen peas - Sometimes I just need vegetables
* Butter - For the peas, the pancakes, the everything
* Fruit: In the summer, cherries, in the fall, pomegranates, in the winter, kiwis, and in the spring, blackberries, raspberries, and peaches. I usually get a sugar craving in the evening and I try to curb it with fruit.

## <a name="Bathroom"></a> Bathroom

#### General

* [Over toilet storage](https://www.amazon.com/Zenna-Home-E2523HB-Bathroom-Spacesaver/dp/B00MP7OVIS/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=over+toilet+storage&qid=1565207037&s=gateway&sr=8-12)
* Shower speaker on carabiner and lanyard
* Gold patterned shower curtain
* Shampoo & Conditioner - Usually whatever smells nice, occasionally in bar form
* Hand Soap - Changes constantly, and is often just a fancy soap given by a family member in a stocking. 
* Razors - I have a subscription to [Billie](https://mybillie.com/) that makes always having a sharp new razor easy and affordable. I love it.
* 3 towels: 1 body towel and 2 hand towels
* [Bath Mat](https://www.target.com/p/ultra-soft-bath-grape-lavender-21-x30-threshold-153/-/A-50316233?ref=&ref=OpsEmail_Order_280&j=7173&sfmc_sub=220351560&l=20_HTML&u=1856896&mid=7284873&jb=1240935) - Unfortunately quite a bit lighter in color than I thought, but it's better than the towel I had been using.
* [Elephant Toothbrush Holder](http://amzn.to/2Gfp018) - This little guy is adorable and perfectly solves the fatal flaw of all toothbrush holders, which is that they retain water in the bottom and get gross. 
* Toothpaste, Floss, and two of the [Quip Toothbrush,](https://www.getquip.com/)  - The Quip toothbrush has seriously improved my oral health, and the toothpaste and floss are whatever I have lying around.
* [Nubian coconut and papaya deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LCTVPP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - My favorite by far, without aluminum, which [might be bad for you, but we're unsure](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/myths/antiperspirants-fact-sheet)
* Kotex [Tampons,](http://amzn.to/2CSIHt6) and [Pads,](http://amzn.to/2DjxAKx) - I keep them in a monogrammed little bag that brings me joy, which makes them pass the KondoMari test, but I try to use as few as I can by sleeping in [Thinx undies](https://www.shethinx.com/products/thinx-boyshort?variant=32896012231)
* [Toilet Paper](http://amzn.to/2qUxd6N) - The nice kind, because your butt is worth it.
* Lint Roller - For that last minute in-the-mirror touch. 

#### <a name="Hair"></a> Hair
I'm not amazing at doing hair, so I cut most of mine off, which means I now use a barrage of aerosols to turn what hair I do have into something presentable each morning. I don't really know how any of these work, but I've slowly figured out how to put some of them together in a way that gives me the pompadour ducktail I crave.

* [Hard Head Hard Hold Hairspray](https://www.tigi.com/bedhead/us/product/hard-heada-hard-hold-hairspray/)
* [REF Fiber Mousse](https://refstockholm.com/produkt/n345-fiber-mousse/) and usually [REF Rough Paste](https://refstockholm.com/produkt/n404-rough-paste/)
* Currently, American Crew Forming Cream instead of REF Rough Paste, because pandemic
* [Conair Hair Dryer](http://amzn.to/2DnsYTE)

#### <a name="Makeup"></a> Makeup
I don't really use makeup. I used to use it for interviews, but since I don't show up to work in makeup, I stopped advertising myself as a makeup wearer in interviews. If I'm dressing up for a formal event, I've found it's much more relaxing to pay to get my makeup done professionally than to do it myself, and it looks a lot better that way too. Still, I have these creams and powders, just in case I ever want to cover up a pimple or provide options that are matched to my skin if a friend is doing my makeup.

* Vera Bradley cosmetics bag - I think this is a cosmetics bag at least, because it's lined with an easily cleanable plastic. It's too small to be a toiletries bag proper, but it's the perfect size to ensure I don't accumulate more makeup than I need (and it's very pretty).
* Elf Complexion Brush
* [Sephora Solid Brush Cleaner](https://www.sephora.com/product/solid-clean-solid-brush-cleaner-P389120)

* [Origins Concealer](http://amzn.to/2mm867o)
* [Clinique Take the Day Off Makeup Remover](http://amzn.to/2CU99SU)
* NARS Orgasm Blush

#### <a name="Medicine"></a> Medicine Cabinet
All things that I don't use every day, but that I do use enough to keep around. Hoping to reduce the amount of medicine I keep on hand by getting healthier as a person, but I have no intention of reducing my festive Band-Aid collection.

* Cotton balls, and Q-Tips
* Nail Polish Remover and One Polish
* Tweezers and Super Nice Japanese Nail Clippers
* Neosporin, Shakespearean Insult, Avengers, Star Wars, and regular Band-Aids

* Extra toothpaste, toothbrush battery, hairspray, shampoo, and razor refills

## <a name="Hobbies"></a> Hobbies

#### <a name="Tea"></a> Tea
I count tea as a hobby, not a food, because the purpose of tea is never to nutritionally sustain myself. Yes, green tea will hydrate me, but buying, owning, and offering tea is really about learning new things, refining my pallet, and meeting new people (you'd be amazed what kind of friends you can make with leaf water). Also, I regularly spend way more money on tea than I do on food. While some of these teas are grocery store buys, several of them come from [The Cultured Cup](https://www.theculturedcup.com/pages/how-to-choose-tea#subheader), [Te Company](https://tecompanytea.com/),  and other high-quality tea vendors, where a single ounce can be over $25. I have no regrets.

#### <a name="Cross"></a> Cross Stitching
I picked cross-stitching back up during the COVID-19 plague and found it to be a very handy strategy for distracting my hands while my brain needs to sit still and pay attention during Zoom class. I keep all these materials together in a little crafting nook in my room, so that they don't take over the rest of my space, and oftentimes home-improvement materials find their way here too.

#### <a name="Alive"></a> Keeping Things Alive
During the COVID-19 plague, I started getting more interested in keeping plants. I'm not great at it, but is' nice to have something other than me alive in my apartment all the time.

* [Purple pot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNVNVFB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with a [ZZ raven plant](https://barkandvineshop.com/products/zz-raven-plant?_pos=2&_sid=f39020f13&_ss=r) named Raven in it
