summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't spark joy in my life. That meant I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why."

The original inspiration for this was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,* which [I really enjoyed.](/details/2017-10-16-The-Life-Changing-Magic-of-Tidying-Up) Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't "spark joy" in your life should be gotten rid of. So, I purged, and everything I kept (and why I have it) is listed below. If you like something and it's underlined, click on it! You'll be sent to its online listing so you can buy it and try it out for yourself.

I began this list January 11th, 2018. It's the first iteration of this post, which I'll (try to) update every couple of years. The most recent update was on: February 4th, 2024. You'll notice an obscene amount of detail here; that's purposeful. By admitting to every item in my home I have to be willing to defend every item, or to accept that it's indefensible. If you have suggestions please give them! I keep notes on what I think I to put more thought into in my "What I Need to Improve" section, and would love to put your notes there as well.

Updating this list for the first time after graduating from school has been really interesting. The way I structure my belongings has completely changed now that I don't walk to class every day, and now that I have a real apartment and the salary to buy belongings that I love. It's a huge point of self pride that I am learning to spend money on myself even for non-necessities, and that I am learning to put down roots and live less like a person on the run.

## <a name="Improve"></a> What I Need to Improve

* I got my mattress in 2019, and I feel like I'm starting to notice it wearing down a bit. I should consider replacing relatively soon.
* I haven't put a whole lot of thought or research into what goes in and around my body during bathroom time. Seeing as things like soap, toothpaste, and deodorant touch sensitive parts of me every day, I should probably do some research.
* Specifically within the bathroom I should cement my knowledge of hair and makeup products. These things can affect my confidence a lot during the day, and I'm currently blundering through them. 
* Should upgrade from plastic to glass for kitchen items like Tupperware and pitchers. 
* Does the kind of soap I use for things like dishes and laundry matter? I feel like it might but don't know, so that needs researching. 
* I've got way too many things in my desk. Really need to cull that down.

Last time I updated this list it was 2021, and I wrote about how I'd gotten rid of hand me downs I didn't love. Strangely enough, in 2024 I feel like I'm still doing the same.

## <a name="Kitchen"></a> Kitchen
I got my first kitchen all to myself in the fall semester of 2017, and I've been trying to figure out how to cook ever since. On the hardware side I try to follow Saint Alton's advice and [stay away from "Unitaskers,"](https://lifehacker.com/watch-alton-brown-demonstrate-why-unitaskers-have-no-1749470145) and I have so many opinions about what foods we put in our bodies that [I wrote a Tedx Talk about food and used it to talk to kids about drugs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7jgNi4Ew8)

## <a name="Hobbies"></a> Hobbies

#### <a name="Tea"></a> Tea
I count tea as a hobby, not a food, because the purpose of tea is never to nutritionally sustain myself. Yes, green tea will hydrate me, but buying, owning, and offering tea is really about learning new things, refining my pallet, and meeting new people (you'd be amazed what kind of friends you can make with leaf water). Also, I regularly spend way more money on tea than I do on food. While some of these teas are grocery store buys, several of them come from [The Cultured Cup](https://www.theculturedcup.com/pages/how-to-choose-tea#subheader), [Te Company](https://tecompanytea.com/), and other high-quality tea vendors, where a single ounce can be over $25. I have no regrets.
