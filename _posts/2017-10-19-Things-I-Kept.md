summary:    "After reading Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up I was inspired to get rid of everything I own that doesn't spark joy in my life. That meant I had to touch and truly consider throwing away everything I own. Here's what I decided to keep and why."

The original inspiration for this was Marie Kondo's book *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,* which [I really enjoyed.](/details/2017-10-16-The-Life-Changing-Magic-of-Tidying-Up) Kondo's thesis is simple: anything that doesn't "spark joy" in your life should be gotten rid of. So, I purged, and everything I kept (and why I have it) is listed below. If you like something and it's underlined, click on it! You'll be sent to Amazon so you can buy it and try it out for yourself.

I began this list January 11th, 2018. It's the first iteration of this post, which I'll (try to) update annually. The most recent update was on: August 24th, 2019. You'll notice an obscene amount of detail here; that's purposeful. By admitting to every item in my home I have to be willing to defend every item, or to accept that it's indefensible. If you have suggestions please give them! I keep notes on what I think I to put more thought into in my "What I Need to Improve" section, and would love to put your notes there as well.

## <a name="Improve"></a> What I Need to Improve

* I haven't put a whole lot of thought or research into what goes in and around my body during bathroom time. Seeing as things like soap, toothpaste, and deodorant touch sensitive parts of me every day, I should probably do some research.
* Specifically within the bathroom I should cement my knowledge of hair and makeup products. These things can affect my confidence a lot during the day, and I'm currently blundering through them. 
* Should upgrade from plastic to glass for kitchen items like Tupperware and pitchers. 
* Does the kind of soap I use for things like dishes and laundry matter? I feel like it might but don't know, so that needs researching. 
* I've got way too many things in my desk. Really need to cull that down. 

## <a name="Everyday"></a> <a name="Backpack"></a> Everyday Carry - My Backpack

* My stepmother's Navy-issue backpack - When my stepmom, who was an equipment operator chief in the Navy reserves, retired she got rid of all her military-issue supplies, and she gave me the option to take anything I wanted. My entire life I had gotten a new backpack at the beginning of each school year, torn it to pieces via the weight and stress of my schoolwork, and repeated the process. I took her backpack on a whim, thinking it might stand up a little longer to my textbooks. That was in 2014, and it's still holding strong today.

#### In That Backpack

* American Airlines blanket - I don't create a lot of body heat, and I spend most of my days in frigidly air-conditioned buildings, so I carry one of those free American Airlines blankets with me for emergencies. I probably use it once a week. I haven't found any blanket as perfectly small, warm, easily folded. 
* Collapsible green travel umbrella - Purchased in a little shop in DC when I found myself caught in the rain, this umbrella is perfect for emergencies. 
* Plastic Bag of drugs, band-aids, & feminine products - Also useful for emergencies, especially for helping others. 
* 8GB 12 Inch MacBook and charger - Owned by [a friend of mine](http://christian.gen.co/) who let me borrow it when my laptop crashed during finals. This lappy is perfectly small so as not to weigh down my bag every day, but also heavy duty enough to help me manage all my work.
* [Decomposition Books](http://amzn.to/2h3wYSX) - A stylish and environmentally friendly option for school notes. A little more expensive than a plain composition book, but worth it for classes where I have to handwrite my notes. 
* [Vera Bradley On a Roll pencil bag](http://amzn.to/2zpqNjg) - Nomadic floral patterned. Holds various pencils, pens, erasers, highlighters, and Sharpies that rotate as I find and lose them, plus the one special pencil below.
* [rOtring 600 0.5 mm Black Barrel Mechanical Pencil](http://amzn.to/2CQJo65) - I was using the cheapest mechanical pencil I could find for years until I was gifted this beauty. It's heavy enough to sit nicely in a hand, the lead virtually never breaks, and it writes wonderfully. 
* Allies bag tag - Awarded to me after my completion of [LGBT Allies](https://www.hrc.org/blog/how-to-be-an-lgbt-ally) training at SMU. 


## <a name="Purse"></a> My Purse

* Leather Fossil Cross Body purse - A gift from my dad that combines fashion and function. Quality purses hold up to a lot of use, and this cross body is perfectly sized and professional enough for business carry, while still remaining casual enough that I can be comfortable using it everywhere - even biking in it. 

#### In That Purse

* Grey Giorgio Armani glasses - I need them to see, and I look objectively better with them on.
* Pink Oliver Peoples sunglasses w/bag - Expensive as all get out, but I feel confident in them
* Coach Glasses Cleaning Cloth - Came with an older iteration of eyewear. Just a piece of cloth, but it says Coach, so I'm fancy.
* iPhone XS - Another gift from my dad and stepmom. I love the huge screen.
* Otterbox blue and pink phone case - A good combination of sturdy and fashionable.
* RE yellow card/coin purse - Replaced my old coinpurse with this one for more capacity. Holds my health insurance card, cash and coins, and whatever gift or rewards cards needed on a particular day.
* Tiny carabiner - Only a couple inches in length, but it holds my house keys.
* [Precise V5 RT Pilot Pen](http://amzn.to/2zpqogK) - The smoothest ink pen I've found. Good enough that I'd re-buy it if I lost it, unlike every other pen I own.
* [Symphonized Wood Headphones](https://amzn.to/2J02Nor) - Aesthetically pleasing and they function and fit my ears. They come with a little shirt clip that really helps to keep at least one ear from slipping out while I exercise. 
* Sasha's lip balm
* Minastrin daily birth control 
* Probably a tampon
* Albuterol sulfate inhaler - Because sometimes my meat suit betrays me and forgets how to breathe.

## <a name="Kitchen"></a> Kitchen

I got my first kitchen all to myself in the fall semester of 2017, and I've been trying to figure out how to cook ever since. On the hardware side I try to follow Saint Alton's advice and [stay away from "Unitaskers,"](https://lifehacker.com/watch-alton-brown-demonstrate-why-unitaskers-have-no-1749470145) and I have so many opinions about what foods we put in our bodies that [I wrote a Tedx Talk and used it to talk to kids about drugs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7jgNi4Ew8)  

#### <a name="Hardware"></a> Hardware

* Chicago Cutlery 10 Piece Knife Set 
* [Chicago Cutlery Honing Rod](http://amzn.to/2DgBPWp)
* Hardwood Cutting Board
* 8 Glass Cups - [Because BPA from plastic is probably bad for you.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331)
* 4 Wine Glasses
* [10 Ball Mason Jars](http://amzn.to/2CWev0e) - Aesthetic, so they can be used as cups for parties and for decorations, and seal-able, so they're great for throwing smoothies or snacks in to take to work. 
* 9 Plastic Tupperware with Tops
* 4 Large Plates, 4 Small Plates, and 4 Bowls - These are bright yellow and made of something that makes them dishwasher, microwave, and oven safe. They couldn't be better. 
* [Faberware Blender](http://amzn.to/2D949yh)
* [Cast Iron Pan](http://amzn.to/2Funwzf) - Though often harder to cook on than my non-stick pans, cast iron probably won't give you cancer, unlike non-stick pans, [which might](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html). So, I'm trying really hard to learn to cook eggs on this thing.
* 4 Nonstick Pans & 5 Nonstick Pots
* 7 Pot and Pan Lids
* 2 glass oil pour containers
* 3 Cookie sheets of various sizes
* Oven Thermometer
* 2 Strainers
* 2 Glass Measuring Cups
* 8 Knives, 8 Forks, 8 Spoons, 3 Sets of Chopsticks
* 5 Metal Mixing Bowls
* Glass Pyrex Casserole dish with Top
* 33 Magnets: Container, Light, [Cat, Dog, Farm, and Safari Butts](http://amzn.to/2DcMi8u), and Teeth
* An Upsetting Number of Things in my Kitchen Catch-All Drawer - 4 scoop measures, holed and un-holed cooking spoons, soup ladle, wine bottle opener, can opener, tongs, mixing spatula (Star Wars themed), 2 wooden spatulas, whisk, bottle opener.
* Step ladder
* [Trash can](https://www.wayfair.com/school-furniture-and-supplies/pdp/wayfair-basics-plastic-13-gallon-step-on-trash-can-w000472815.html?category=1864277&placement=1&slot=0&sponsoredid=d6e4b8880135f59b1915cb0feef82380bae7456d89e96bd6628d96eecc312614&_txid=otAicF1LNPY1TQlUb3clAg%3D%3D&isB2b=0)

#### <a name="Sink"></a> In and Under the Sink

* Chain mail (for cleaning the cast iron)
* [Clorox Wipes](http://amzn.to/2D6oosg)
* [Windex Multi-surface Vinegar](http://amzn.to/2D4TIHL)
* [Meyer's Clean Day Dish Soap](http://amzn.to/2r7xEe1) and Dish Sponges
* [Cascade Dishwasher Detergent](http://amzn.to/2D899iq)
* [Tide Pods,](http://amzn.to/2DBMkot) and a huge Tide detergent bag
* [Downy Dryer Sheets](http://amzn.to/2r8yVl7) - The Lavender smell. Always the lavender smell. 
* Paper Towels - I bought the cheap ones and have never regretted such a small purchase so much in my life. The commercials were right. They don't absorb anything and tear tear-ibly. Never again.
* Large, medium, and small, high-quality trash bags - For the same reason I will now buy high quality paper towels, but I couldn't think of a pun for this one. 

## <a name="Bathroom"></a> Bathroom

#### General

* [Over toilet storage](https://www.amazon.com/Zenna-Home-E2523HB-Bathroom-Spacesaver/dp/B00MP7OVIS/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=over+toilet+storage&qid=1565207037&s=gateway&sr=8-12)
* Shampoo & Conditioner - Usually whatever smells nice, occasionally in bar form
* Tupperware full of Coconut Oil - I stopped using body wash a while back because [it's probably bad for your skin](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/expert-warns-using-soap-in-shower-may-actually-be-bad-for-us-in-long-term-a6697771.html). I started putting coconut oil on after most showers instead, since [hot water, like soap, strips good oils from skin](http://www.newsweek.com/do-hot-showers-dry-your-skin-96379). I haven't noticed any negative effects, but I also haven't noticed anything positive, so who knows. 
* Hand Soap - Changes constantly, and is often just a fancy soap given by a family member in a stocking. 
* Face Wash and Washer - I've had pretty noticeable acne all my life, so I've experimented with soaps a lot. [Origins Checks and Balances](http://amzn.to/2FvyHaL) does a great job for my skin, and only takes about 60 seconds in the shower thanks to my [Olay Face Brush](http://amzn.to/2CRiieZ). I use this sparingly, but it's great for taking off makeup or the sweat of a long day.
* Razors - I have a subscription to [Billie](https://mybillie.com/) that makes always having a sharp new razor easy and affordable.
* Towels - Right now I have two sets: one purple, and one grey.
* [Bath Mat](https://www.target.com/p/ultra-soft-bath-grape-lavender-21-x30-threshold-153/-/A-50316233?ref=&ref=OpsEmail_Order_280&j=7173&sfmc_sub=220351560&l=20_HTML&u=1856896&mid=7284873&jb=1240935) - Unfortunately quite a bit lighter in color than I thought, but it's better than the towel I had been using.
* [Elephant Toothbrush Holder](http://amzn.to/2Gfp018) - This little guy is adorable and perfectly solves the fatal flaw of all toothbrush holders, which is that they retain water in the bottom and get gross. 
* [Quip Toothbrush,](https://www.getquip.com/) Toothpaste, and Floss - The Quip toothbrush has seriously improved my oral health, and the toothpaste and floss are whatever I have lying around.
* Deodorant without Aluminum - Still figuring out what deodorant works best for me
* [Kleenex with Lotion](http://amzn.to/2CSOoao) - Boxes of these are all over my place, but the extras live here so here's where I'll list them. These are the softest and sturdiest tissues I've found, and I blow my nose constantly.
* Kotex [Tampons,](http://amzn.to/2CSIHt6) [Pads,](http://amzn.to/2DjxAKx) and [Panty Liners](http://amzn.to/2Do2ulh) - Trying to go away from these and to the [Diva Cup](http://amzn.to/2zqtBNt) and [Flex](https://flexfits.com/). I keep them in a monogrammed little bag that brings me joy, making them pass the KondoMari test.
* [Diva Cup](http://amzn.to/2zqtBNt) - Safer and less trash-producing than tampons. Switching to this was weird, but now I lovingly refer to it as my blood cup. 
* [Toilet Paper](http://amzn.to/2qUxd6N) - The nice kind, because your butt is worth it.
* Lint Roller - For that last minute in-the-mirror touch. 
* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hMsnWnPt.jpg" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem"> [IKEA FILUR trash can](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40188340/?query=401.883.40) - The perfect size for sitting next to the toilet with a handy dandy lid to cover up the nasties within. A very artistic friend decorated mine beautifully with sharpie, and now this simple household necessity is a tiny beacon of happiness. 

<br>

#### <a name="Hair"></a> Hair
I'm really bad at doing hair, so I cut most of mine off, which means I now use a barrage of aerosols to turn what hair I do have into something presentable each morning. I don't really know how any of these work, and whether or not I have a good hair day is often about as dependent on my skill level as it is dependent on the phase of the moon and the number of seagulls over the West coast. Nevertheless, these tools seem to help.

* [TRESemmé Hairspray](http://amzn.to/2EAULiP) and [Mousse](http://amzn.to/2qRBWG8)
* Catwalk Mousse
* [Puff Me Volumizing Cloud Mist](http://amzn.to/2FrJLFZ)
* [REF Rough Paste](http://refstockholm.com/product/rough-paste/) - Recommended by my hairstylist, and a huge step up from the Axe paste I had been using.
* [Conair Hair Dryer](http://amzn.to/2DnsYTE)
* Hair Brush

#### <a name="Makeup"></a> Makeup
I like makeup in the same way I like my laptop: I'm 100% sure that I use it incorrectly 50% of the time, but it's fun and useful nonetheless. Most of my collection is either gifts, free samples, or pieces my helpful friends at Sephora have pointed me to when I come in with an empty foundation and a look of terror. Bless them and their patience.

* Vera Bradley cosmetics bag - I think this is a cosmetics bag at least, because it's lined with an easily cleanable plastic. It's too small to be a toiletries bag proper, but it's the perfect size to ensure I don't accumulate more makeup than I need (and it's very pretty).
* [7 Piece Elf Brush Set](http://amzn.to/2FvsifB) 
* [Sephora Airbrush Sponge](https://www.sephora.com/product/the-painter-airbrush-sponge-P394161)
* [Anita NARS lipstick](http://amzn.to/2iRYtzb) - The perfect professional shade, with a magnetic case that doesn't come open in your purse.
* [Sephora Solid Brush Cleaner](https://www.sephora.com/product/solid-clean-solid-brush-cleaner-P389120)
* [Makeup Forever Mascara](http://amzn.to/2D3I5nv)
* [Hello Flawless Powder](http://amzn.to/2D0uT35)
* [Tarte BB Cream](http://amzn.to/2DpxiCd)
* [Makeup Forever Concealer](http://amzn.to/2qYcZsO)
* [Origins Concealer](http://amzn.to/2mm867o)
* [Kat Von D Lipstick HEXAGRAM](http://amzn.to/2Dl2Dph)
* Sephora Contour & Color Lip Colors: [Rosewood](http://amzn.to/2FvOC91), [Light Nude](http://amzn.to/2DpkETG), [Deep Rose](http://amzn.to/2Dpl6Bm)
* Clinique Lipsticks: [A Different Grape](http://amzn.to/2EyTjOh) & [Bamboo Pink](http://amzn.to/2Dj7M17)

* [Clinique Rinse off Eye Makeup Solvent](http://amzn.to/2mlQ1pN)

#### <a name="Tea"></a> Tea
I count tea as a hobby, not a food, because the purpose of tea is never to nutritionally sustain myself. Yes, green tea will hydrate me, but buying, owning, and offering tea is really about learning new things, refining my pallet, and meeting new people (you'd be amazed what kind of friends you can make with leaf water). Also, I regularly spend way more money on tea than I do on food. While some of these teas are grocery store buys, several of them come from [The Cultured Cup](https://www.theculturedcup.com/pages/how-to-choose-tea#subheader) and other high-quality tea vendors, where a single ounce can be over $25. I have no regrets.

#### <a name="Rock"></a> Rock Climbing
I think hauling myself up vertical surfaces is incredibly fun, but it's also dangerous and complicated, so I use this gear to maximize enjoyment and safety. I got a lot of this second hand, so I don't know exactly what kind it is, but I really like it.

#### <a name="Bike"></a> Biking
I already enjoyed biking for exercise and relaxation and wanted to be the kind of person who biked for transportation, so I went all in and got a possibly unnecessarily nice bike for myself around Christmas of the junior year of my undergraduate. I'm now the kind of person who bikes for transportation, and I love it.
