<h2>Take-Aways</h2>

<b>Positives:</b>

- Buying clothes that make me feel confident was a big positive this year, probably spurred on by the combination of knowing that I would soon be making a good salary, and feeling more confident in my own skin thanks to time in the gym. Near the end of the year, I've really come to realize how much of my clothing is just hand-me-downs that never really sparked joy, they were just better than nothing, or better than what else I could afford. In the next year, I'd like to spend an inordinate amount of money getting clothes that make me feel great.
- Feeling good about my body because of exercise was a big positive this year too. Definitely going to keep that rolling next year. 

<b>Negatives:</b>

- My most consistent stress this year came from various romantic relationship troubles, which is difficult to "fix" because a lot of my big positives of the year came from romantic relationship things too. I'm pretty sure that's just the paradox of being vulnerable and known with people, but I'll try to keep my eye out next year to make sure I'm not staying in situations that aren't great.
